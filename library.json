  "description": "This library enables you to use Interrupt from Hardware Timers on an Arduino megaAVR board, such as UNO WiFi Rev2, AVR_NANO_EVERY, etc. It now supports 16 ISR-based timers, while consuming only 1 hardware Timer. Timers' interval is very long (ulong millisecs). The most important feature is they're ISR-based timers. Therefore, their executions are not blocked by bad-behaving functions or tasks. This important feature is absolutely necessary for mission-critical tasks.",
